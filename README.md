In this repository you can find implementation of popular card games.

  The cards_war is a simple game known as "war" in witch 2 players or more then one splits the 52 pack card equally. The game is simple when a player puts a card down the other plyers will also put a card down and who has the biggest card wins the hand, if there are more then 2 card which are the same then war begins. At this point the players who are at war must give the number of card that are down. For example: player 1 puts down card 5 of hearts and player 2 puts down card 5 of spades bouth player must put down 5 card and who has the biggest card after this war wins the hand.
  The implementation is in Python. It is using basic Object Oriented concepts. The class card is used to define object that have the 2 attributs of normal card: number and card_type and the class player has 4 attributes: name- name of the player, nr_card- gives the number of the card, cards- gives the card that the player has in his hands and war_hand- is a list that is used when war is happening.
